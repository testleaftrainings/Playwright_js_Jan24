*Agenda*

- Recap
- Conditional Statements
- Looping
- String
- Arrays


In this module, we will take a look at the following

# Strings
    - Defining a string
    - String object/class
    - Methods in String
# Arrays
    - Defining an array
    - Array object/class
    - Methods & operations on an array
# Functions
    - Defining functions, functional expressions
    - return values of a function
    - Arguments of a function
    -Async, Await
    - Promise

# Classwork -1

1)  Javascript File Name: 01_learn.js
 
    Objective: Learn Primitive Data Types
 
    Create the following variables using var and check their typeOf
 
    a) firstName
    b) companyName
    c) mobileNumber
    d) isAutomation
    e) hasPlaywright (do not assign)
 
    print and confirm the values and data types
 
    Time: 10 Minutes (including setup)

# Classwork-2

Use same Javascript File Name: 01_learn.js
 
    Objective: Learn var vs let vs const and understand variable scoping
 
    Declare a const name as browserName (global)
    Assign value as "Chrome"
    Create a function by name getBrowserVersion
    Create if condition inside function to check if browser is chrome, then
    Declare a local variable -- use var first (browserVersion) and print that variable inside function (outside block)
    Call that function from the javascript
 
    - Use 'var' first as block variable and then convert that as 'let'
    - Confirm how it works
 
    - function how to write and how to call
    - basic if condition and block variable
    - let vs var

# Classroom-3
Use new Javascript File Name: 02_Conditional.js
 
    Objective: Learn if - else and switch - case
    Create 2 functions : launchBrowser, runTests
    where,
    a) launchBrowser need to take input as browserName (string) and do not return any
        - use if, else (chrome or otherwise)
        - just print
    b) runTests need to take input as testType (string) and do not return any
        - use switch case (smoke, sanity, regression, default (smoke))
        - just do print
 
    Call that function from the javascript

# Classroom-4
int val = 10; // 1,2,3,4,...10
function for odd or even !!

print odd numbers between 1 to n // 1,3,5,7,9

# Classroom-5
If the given string and reverse string is same --> palindrome

Objective: If the given string is palindrome

hints:

1) use the above logic to reverse the string
2) if the reverse string === original string --> true else the false

# Classroom-6

1) Find the number of occurances.  

const nums = [2,4,5,2,1,2];
const k = 2
// output >> 3

hint: loop through the array and compare the k with array index value and if matches, increase the count
